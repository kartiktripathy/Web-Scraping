# Web-Scraping
An introduction to Web Scraping, where we will scrape the data from a website with the url: http://coreyms.com
Here we would be scraping the Header, the Summary and the link of the video.
We would be using the BeautifuLSoup library and the lxml parser.
At last we would be saving the data in a CSV format.
